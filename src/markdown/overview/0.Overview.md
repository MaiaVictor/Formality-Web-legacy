a simples `line of code`

## Why?

- Formality has a type system capable of proving mathematical theorems about its own programs. It's not only about preventing bugs or proving the theorem itself. We are talking about a whole new tool to work with, a language of specifications, one on which we can state precisely, in a way that a computer can understand, what an algorithm is supposed to do.

- No garbage-collection, optimal beta-reduction and a massively parallel GPU compiler make it insanely fast.
Massively parallel evaluation is possible due to Symmetric Interaction Calculus (SIC), a new model of computation that combines the best aspects of the Turing Machine and the Î»-Calculus.

- Its reference implementation, including parser, stringifier, evaluator and type checker has about 1,000 lines of code. This is important to:

  1. Portability: we want Formality to be a library in many languages, just like JSON

  2. Trust: we don't want people to trust on a single, monolithic, bug-prone implementation
