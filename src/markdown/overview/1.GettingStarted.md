# Get started

To install Formality, you must have npm. Once you do, just type:

    npm i -g formality-lang

Now you can create a file with the extension `.fm` and execute it using

    formality -n (file_name)

Then you’re good to go. Optionally, you can also use it as a JS library or, if you don’t want to download anything, you can try our online editor [here](/tryIt).
